# Epic: Governed environments for Ray workloads

*Drafted 2026-09-12 from a scoping pass over Ray's environment model, vendor
patterns (Anyscale, Databricks, SageMaker), and Bifrost's existing governance
surface. File with `scripts/file-environments-epic.sh` when GitHub is
reachable.*

## Epic statement

A user composes the environment their job or cluster needs — base image +
packages + env vars — from an administrator-governed subset, through the API
(and later the console), with versioning, audit, and security gates; no
arbitrary Dockerfiles, no unvetted image pushes.

## Why

Research summary:

- Ray's `runtime_env` (pip/conda/working_dir/env_vars) is powerful but **fully
  ungoverned in Bifrost today**: `RayJobSpec.runtime_env_yaml` passes verbatim
  into the RayJob CR (`internal/api/rayjobs.go:81`,
  `internal/provision/rayjob.go:114`). A user can set
  `pip_install_options: ["--index-url", "https://evil"]`, `py_executable`,
  `image_uri`, or remote `working_dir` URIs fetched with node credentials.
- Vendor pattern consensus (Anyscale base images + restricted containerfiles,
  Databricks versioned runtimes, SageMaker image catalogs): **a governed
  catalog of named, versioned environments; users pick and lightly
  parameterize; nobody ships raw Dockerfiles.** This matches Bifrost's
  existing profile/storage governance posture exactly.
- What exists to build on: the profile catalog pattern
  (`internal/api/profiles.go` — validated as a unit on the policy row,
  project-scoped, expanded at create, never retroactive), the
  `AllowedImagePrefixes` admission mechanism (`internal/api/admission.go`),
  and the storage catalog's resolve-by-name pattern (`internal/api/storage.go`).
- Missing: environment as a first-class named/versioned/shareable object;
  any validation of `runtime_env_yaml`; an environment story for interactive
  clusters; package governance; a build pipeline.

## Security model (both MVP and post-MVP)

- MVP (runtime_env-backed): residual risk is pip supply chain — reduced to
  "packages from the platform proxy only, names allowlisted, versions pinned"
  (default-deny tenant egress already exists; the proxy becomes the only
  install egress).
- Post-MVP (server-side image builds): residual risk is builder privilege —
  contained by rootless builders in an isolated namespace/SA, generated-only
  Containerfiles (FROM allowlisted base + pip lines, no user RUN),
  digest-pinned tags, cosign signatures verified at admission, scan gate
  before an environment can leave draft.

2 (runtime_env governance) — independent, land first as risk reduction
```

### Issue 1 — Contract: EnvironmentSpec schema and `environment` references (bifrost-api)

As the API contract owner, I want a versioned schema for a named environment
and a way for job/cluster specs to reference one, so all three repos build
against one frozen shape.

Scope: bifrost-api repo only. New `EnvironmentSpec`: `name`, `description`,
`base_image` (allowlisted prefix), `packages` (pinned `name==version` list,
pip syntax subset), `env_vars` (map), `runtime_env_yaml` (optional escape
hatch), `projects` (empty = all), `status` (draft|published|deprecated),
`published_by`, `published_at`, `scan` (nullable verdict ref). Specs gain
optional `environment: string` on `RayJobSpec` and `ClusterSpec`; policy
document gains an `environments` section; `GET /environments` mirroring
`GET /profiles`.

Acceptance: pinned-version requirement enforced at contract level (pattern);
fully backward compatible (all fields optional); generated Go types drop into
`zz_generated_api.go` cleanly.

Blocks: 2, 3, 7, 8.

### Issue 2 — Govern `runtime_env_yaml` as it exists today

As an admin, I want the existing free-form `runtime_env_yaml` validated
against policy so today's passthrough stops being an open supply-chain and
egress hole before the environment feature lands.

Scope: `internal/api/rayjobs.go`, new `internal/api/runtimeenv.go`,
`internal/core` policy types, `internal/api/admission.go`. Parse at submit;
field allowlist (default `pip`, `env_vars`, `config`; deny `py_executable`,
`image_uri`, `conda` unless enabled); deny `pip_install_options` with
`--index-url`/`--extra-index-url`/`--find-links` unless admin-declared;
`working_dir`/`py_modules` remote URIs default-deny; cap
`setup_timeout_seconds`; package denylist. Refusals 400 with audit reason
`runtime_env_rejected`. Documented permissive toggle preserves current
behavior for upgraders (default governed).

Independent; land first as risk reduction.

### Issue 3 — Environment catalog on the policy row

As an admin, I want a catalog of named environments editable via
`PUT /settings/policy`, validated as a unit, project-scoped, exactly like
profiles and storage.

Scope: new `internal/core/environment.go`, `internal/api/settings.go`, new
`internal/api/environments.go` (list/read). Copy the storage.go pattern: unit
validation at edit (unique RFC 1123 names, base image in admission allowlist,
pinned packages, denylist, valid status transitions), project scoping,
`[]`-never-`null`. Read side mirrors `ListProfiles` including project-scoped
narrowing.

Depends on: 1. Blocks: 4, 6.

### Issue 4 — Environment resolution at admission, jobs and clusters

As a user, I name `environment: "ml-base"` on my job or cluster and get its
packages/env applied, with the resolution pinned to my spec so a later
catalog edit never retroactively changes my workload.

Scope: `internal/api/rayjobs.go` (`finishJobSpec`),
`internal/api/clusters.go`, `internal/provision/rayjob.go`. Name → compiled
`runtime_env` YAML; merge with request-supplied `runtime_env_yaml` (conflict
= 400, mirroring profile expansion's whole-or-nothing rule); store as
`EnvironmentResolved` on the spec. Interactive clusters: applied via the
job-submission path and documented as cluster-wide default (Ray has no
cluster-level runtime_env on the CR — design note). Unknown/foreign name =
400 like `resolveStorage`.

Depends on: 2, 3. Blocks: 5.

### Issue 5 — MVP: runtime_env-backed environments end to end

As a user, I submit a job naming a published environment and its pip packages
install at job start, with caching, a bounded setup timeout, and clear
failure surfacing.

Scope: `internal/provision/rayjob.go`, `internal/controller` (status
surfacing), docs. Force `config.setup_timeout_seconds` default; explicit
tenant-egress rule to the platform package proxy (default-deny egress bites
here — see defects 2026-09-03, 2026-09-08); surface runtime-env setup failure
in job `message`; document caching and cold-start honestly. New requirement
probe `test/requirements/r1x_environments`: pinned pure-python package
imports successfully; install failure produces a useful failed-job message;
works behind default-deny egress with only the proxy allowed.

Depends on: 4. **This is the MVP's done line.**

### Issue 6 — Publication workflow, versioning, audit

As an admin, I want environments drafted, published, and deprecated with an
audit trail and explicit RBAC on who may publish vs use.

Scope: `internal/api/environments.go`, `internal/auth`, audit actions
(`publish_environment`, `deprecate_environment`). MVP keeps the catalog
admin-only via `PUT /settings/policy` (recommended — matches profiles);
user-submitted drafts with admin approval are deferred. Status transitions
enforced; deprecated refuses new references but stored resolutions keep
working.

Depends on: 3.

### Issue 7 — CVE/scan gate for environments

As a security admin, I want an environment's packages and base image to carry
a scan verdict that admission can require to be clean.

Scope: contract `scan` field (Issue 1), admission rule
`require_scanned_environments`, docs. MVP: verdict is a recorded field an
admin sets after running an offline scanner (trivy/grype on the base image;
pip-audit on the package list) — no scanner integration in the control plane;
ship a `scripts/` helper for the offline workflow. Later: CronJob that scans
and PATCHes the verdict.

Depends on: 3, 4. Can land after MVP (rule defaults off).

### Issue 8 — Console affordances (bifrost-ui; interface spec only)

As a console user, I want an environment picker and a guided builder (base
image dropdown, package editor with allowlist validation, env var table,
version history) — never a Dockerfile editor.

Scope: bifrost-ui repo; thin interface description: `GET /environments`
drives pickers on job-submit and cluster-create forms; builder form
constructs `EnvironmentSpec` drafts; validation errors surface the API's
precise 400s; read-only "resolved environment" view on detail pages.
Non-goal: raw YAML editor in the guided path.

Depends on: 1, 3. Parallel with 4–7.

### Issue 9 — Design: server-side image builds (ADR + spike, post-MVP gate)

As the platform team, we want a written decision on whether/how to build
images server-side so heavy dependencies (compiled wheels, CUDA stacks,
system packages) get a reproducible, scannable path.

Scope: docs/adr + spike. Compare kaniko vs buildah vs rootless BuildKit vs
external CI + prefix allowlist (status quo+). Generated Containerfiles only
(FROM allowlisted base + pip lines), never user-authored Dockerfiles.
Deliverable: ADR with go/no-go, cost estimate, security model (builder
namespace/SA, egress to package proxy only, digest-pinned tags, cosign).

Depends on: MVP usage data (5). Blocks: 10.

### Issue 10 — Image-build pipeline implementation (post-MVP, if Issue 9 says go)

As a user, I can request an environment whose heavy deps are baked into an
image built by the platform, scanned, signed, and automatically added to my
project's allowed prefixes.

Scope: new builder component (separate namespace/SA), build status on the
environment, registry integration. Out of MVP by construction.

Depends on: 9.

## MVP recommendation

**MVP = Issues 2, 1, 3, 4, 5 (+ 6 in reduced admin-only form).** Govern the
existing passthrough, then catalog-backed named environments compiling to
governed `runtime_env` YAML on RayJobs. No image builds in MVP: zero new
infrastructure, copies two proven in-repo patterns (storage catalog
resolution, profile expansion), and the catalog shape carries forward
unchanged when image builds arrive.

Triggers that should force the image-build conversation: compiled/native deps
(CUDA, GDAL), cold-start complaints cache tuning can't fix, or a compliance
requirement for pre-scanned immutable artifacts.

## Open decisions

- User-submitted draft environments vs admin-only catalog — recommend
  admin-only for MVP (Issue 6), matching profiles.
- New requirement number for traceability (r10/r11 are adjacent but distinct)
  — add a row to `docs/requirements/` when work starts.
