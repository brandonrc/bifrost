// Requirement 8 — the store-loss drill. The restart tests in this package
// kill the control-plane pod but keep its SQLite store on the PVC; this
// drill takes the store itself away (scale-to-zero, delete and re-create
// the data PVC — see k8sHandle.destroyStore for why the volume, not an
// in-pod rm) while a cluster is running, then watches what the design
// actually does with an EMPTY store:
//
//   - DetectStaleRestore (internal/controller/reconcile.go) only fires when
//     a store row exists whose generation lags the backing cluster's. An
//     empty store has no rows, so no quarantine: the control plane comes up
//     healthy and actuates new work normally. That is what the code
//     promises for this failure shape, and this test pins it.
//   - The pre-wipe cluster's record is gone with the store, and nothing
//     re-adopts the backing RayCluster: every reconcile pass iterates
//     store.List, so a cluster the store forgot is never observed, never
//     reaped, never alarmed on. It becomes an unmanaged orphan. That
//     recovery gap is pinned with req.NotYetBuilt — when adoption (or an
//     empty-store quarantine) is built, the body starts passing and the
//     marker comes out in the same PR.
